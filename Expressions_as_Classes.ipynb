The class **Expr** is the generic class denoting an expression.  It is an _abstract_ class: only its subclasses will be instantiated.  For every operator, such as `+`, there will be a subclass, such as `Plus`.  Variables will correspond to a special subclass, called `V`.  Numerical constants will be just represented by numbers, and not by subclasses of `Expr`. \n","\n","## The `Expr` class\n","\n","The `Expr` class implements the various [methods used to emulate numerical types](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?#emulating-numeric-types), such as `__add__`, `__sub__`, and so forth.  In this way, we can build an expression simply by writing\n","\n","    x = V()\n","    x * 3 / 2\n","\n","In the above, `V()` creates a variable (an object of class `V`), and assigns it to `x`.  Then, \n","\n","    x * 3\n","\n","will also be an expression, composed of a multiplication node, with children the variable in `x`, and `3`. \n","The multiplication node is implemented via a subclass `Multiply` of `Expr`. \n","To make this work, we will define the [`__mul__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mul__) method of `Expr` so that it produces a `Multiply` object, with as children the two operands being multiplied. \n","\n","Similarly, \n","\n","    x * 3 / 2\n","\n","will create an object of class `Divide`, with as left child the `Multiply` node for `x * 3`, and as right child, the number 2.

In other words, the code is far more modular.  This may seem a small point, but if one were to extend the representation of expressions to involve tensors (matrices) and operations on tensors, as is done in the symbolic representation of expressions used in machine-learning, the number of operators could easily grow to a hundred or more, making a modular approach the only reasonable one. \n","\n","Third, it becomes possible to attach methods to the expression objects, and as we will see in the next chapter, this can be very useful to implement machine learning frameworks.
